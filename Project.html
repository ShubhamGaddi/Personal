        <ul>
          <li><strong>Adjustable Heel Design using Bamboo – B. Tech 4th Semester Project [May 2019]    </strong></li>
            <ul>
              <li>Built a heel attachment that could be adjusted to 2 different heights using different types of bamboo only.</li>
              <li>Project was made for a course and was capable of operating at the two heights of 3inches and 5 inches.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
          <li><strong>Line follower with Obstacle Detection [April 2019] </strong></li>
            <ul>
              <li>Built a line follower bot with obstacle detection and retracking using Arduino Uno.  </li>
              <li>Bot worked perfectly and components used include DC motors, motor – driver IC, Arduino UNO, breadboard, wires and other small things as per requirements. </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
          <li><strong>Genesis [March 2019]</strong></li>
            <ul>
              <li>Part of the combustion ATV building team of the college that participated in MAC [Mega ATV Championship] 2019.</li>
              <li>Was a part of the chassis team and worked actively in suspension and transmission teams as well.</li>
              <li>The vehicle built was able to clear the technical inspection, electrical as well as the braking test at the competition held in Goa in March 2019 and ran continuously for a total time of approximately 4.5 hours during the endurance testing.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
          <li><strong>E-Genesis [February 2019]</strong></li>
            <ul>
              <li>Part of the electrical ATV building team of the college that participated in ESI [Enduro Student India] 2019.</li>
              <li>Was a part of the chassis team and worked actively in suspension and transmission teams as well. </li>
              <li>The vehicle built was able to clear the technical inspection as well as the electrical tests at the competition held in Pune in February 2019.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
          <li><strong>Digital Tachometer – B. Tech 3rd Semester Project [November 2018]</strong></li>
            <ul>
              <li>Built a tachometer that could give the speed of a rotating object in RPS in the form of a digital readout. Project was made for a course. </li>
              <li>Components used include basic logic gates, decade counters, IR couple, 7 – segment displays, breadboards and wires.</li>
              <li>Worked perfectly and gave readings with an accuracy of approximately 85%. </li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
